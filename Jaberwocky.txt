Twas brillig and the slithey toves
did gyhrre and gimble in the wabe.
All mimsey were the borogoves
and the mome wrathe outgrabe. 

"Beware the Jaberwock, my son!
The jaws that snatch, the claws that clatch
Beware the Jub-Jub Bird, and shun
the frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his mapt mobil in hand
long time the maxome foe he sought
then rested he by a Tum Tum Tree
and stood a while in thought. 

And as in uffish thought he stood
the Jaberwock with eyes of flame
came buffling through the Tulgy Wood
and wharbled as it came.
